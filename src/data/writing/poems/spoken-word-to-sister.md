To my sister, to whom I owe all of my wisdom \
Or, what you’d call teenage stupidity.\
Except, you being the musician and me the writer,\
I’d say the phrase for you and you’d nod and agree\
because you trust my use of words more than your own. \
And I’d do the same while playing piano,\
when you’d correct my C#m7b5 add 9 chord to a C#m7b5 add 11 chord.\
Because I trust you. \
Also because I don’t know the difference\
And you’ll stop nagging after I listen.

You and I, we’re like that. \
Two parts in harmony. \
_Yin and Yang_ I’d say. \
_G7b9 resolved to Cmaj7 add9_ you’d say.

We know how to make each other smile. \
You send me merchandise from your college,\
I photoshop your school in a nuclear blast.\
You text me photos of college wildlife,\
I send you pictures of our dog,\
so that you don’t miss him as much.\
Because whenever you return home,\
He sleeps beside you,\
As if he thinks you’ll leave \
and never come back.

We still make faces at each other over Skype\
And send unflattering selfies during class.\
We compare our biceps and triceps in the mirror.\
Who is the strongest? The bravest? The best?\
Then suddenly, who is the grossest? The dumbest? \
We even argue over who is the fattest. \
Only, every time we conclude it’s me. \
And somehow that never ceases to crack us up.

Only I understand your humor \
Only I understand your bluntness.\
And only I can differentiate the two. \
When I sneeze, you say\
_You are not blessed._\
When I say, _That plant looks ugly._\
You say, _It probably thinks you’re ugly too._

But we weren’t always so compatible.\
We were once as immiscible as oil and water\
Water and fire,\
Fire and a vacuum.\
Or maybe fire and gasoline \
Because when combined we would explode\
In a brawl of shrieks and screams ending in floods of tears,\
that ended with both of us in trouble.\
And when we played Lego Star Wars \
We shot and killed each other\
Because we both wanted to go separate ways,\
But the screen didn’t allow us to.

But now we are inseparable. \
We’re chains interlocked around a fence,\
boats and their masts sailing an ocean,\
planets caught in each other’s orbit.\
It is impossible to pull us apart.\
_Like strong magnets,_ I’d say.\
_Like how hard it is to dislocate your jaw,_ you’d say.

We refuse to let go\
Even though we’re three hundred eighty two miles apart while you’re at college.\
Because we have a love that transcends time and space.

Of course,\
I’d never say that to your face\
And you to mine.\
Because that’s too weird for even us. \
Two sisters who happen to be best friends. \
Two best friends who happen to be sisters.\
We won the lottery somehow\
A one in a million chance. \
_Like surviving a plane crash,_ I’d say.\
_Like finding an extra contact in your new contact case,_ you’d say.
